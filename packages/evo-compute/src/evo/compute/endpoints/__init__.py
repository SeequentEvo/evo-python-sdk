Task API
=============


    The Task API provides the ability to execute computation tasks in Evo that require variable, on-demand
    processing power. Building the Task API into your application can enable fast processing of long
    running, or resource intensive operations, without depending on the end user's physical hardware.

    Tasks are created, triggering a job to be executed asynchronously within a specific topic for your organization,
    and can be monitored throughout their execution lifecycle.

    For more information on using the Task API, see [Overview](/docs/guides/tasks), or the API
    references here.

This code is generated from the OpenAPI specification for Task API.
