# Security

Seequent takes software security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts in finding and responsibly reporting
security issues and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please do not open GitHub issues to report potential security issues. If you think you've found a vulnerability in
our software, please email security@seequent.com. Include the word "SECURITY" and this repository name in the
subject line. Include the versions of software you're using and other necessary context (e.g. operating system),
and steps to reproduce.

Refer to [Seequent's approach to security](https://www.seequent.com/help-support/security/), and
