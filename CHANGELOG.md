## evo-sdk@v0.1.9
### What's Changed
#### evo-sdk
* Added a new `evo.jmespath` module to `evo-sdk-common`
  * `JMESPathArrayProxy` and `JMESPathObjectProxy` - wrappers around `Sequence[T]` and `Mapping[str, T]` objects respecively, adding support for:
    * JMESPath expressions via `__getitem__()`
      * `__getitem__()` returns a `JMESPathArrayProxy` instance where the result would be a `Sequence`
      * `__getitem__()` returns a `JMESPathObjectProxy` instance where the result would be a `Mapping`
    * a `json_dumps(*args, **kwargs)` method that is `json.dumps(*args, **kwargs)`, except the default encoder also serializes `mappingproxy` and `UUID` instances.
    * a `__repr__()` method that pretty-prints the data with indentation, via `json_dumps()`
  * a `proxy()` method that wraps `Sequence` and `Mapping` values in a `JMESPathArrayProxy` or `JMESPathObjectProxy` respectively. All other types are returned unmodified.
  * a custom `ParsedResult` (extending `jmespath.parser.ParsedResult` that passes the search result through `proxy()`
  * a `compile()` method that wraps `jmespath.compile()`, transforming the result into an `evo.jmespath.ParsedResult`
  * a `search()` method that is identical to `jmespath.search()`, except it uses `evo.jmespath.compile().search()`
  * `JMESPathError` is exposed here as a matter of convenience
