# Evo Code Samples

Welcome to the Evo Python SDK code samples! This directory contains comprehensive Jupyter notebook examples that demonstrate how to use the various Evo APIs for geoscience data management and analysis.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Evo app**: You need a [registered app in Bentley](https://developer.bentley.com/register/?product=seequent-evo) to obtain a client ID
- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **Jupyter Environment**: JupyterLab, VS Code, or another Jupyter notebook editor

## üöÄ Quick start

### 1. Register an Evo app

Register your Evo application in the [Bentley Developer Portal](https://developer.bentley.com/my-apps) to get your client credentials. If a member of your team has already registered an app, contact them and ask for the client credentials. For in-depth instructions, follow this [guide](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/apps-and-tokens) on the Seequent Developer Portal.

a. In a new browser tab or window, visit [https://developer.bentley.com/](https://developer.bentley.com/) and sign in.

b. Click your profile in the top-right corner and select **My Apps**. You may need to agree to Bentley developer terms before proceeding.

    ```bash
    # Move to the samples directory
    cd samples

    # Install the dependencies
    uv sync
    ```

### Linux

NOTE: This example is based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com), but other Linux environments will operate in a similar way.

1. Find the local copy of this repository in **Files**. It will be called **evo-python-sdk-main** if you downloaded as a ZIP file.
1. Right-click on the folder and choose **Open in Terminal**.

    <img src="../docs/img/open-terminal-ubuntu.png" alt="Open a terminal on Windows" width="600" />

1. Enter the following command to install `uv`.
    ```bash
    # From the root directory of the repository
    ./scripts/install-uv.sh
    ```

1. Set up your environment by moving to the **samples** directory and installing the Python dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Move to the samples directory
    cd samples

    # Install the dependencies
    uv sync
    ```

### 4. Run the notebooks

From the **samples** directory, launch Jupyter.

```bash
uv run jupyter notebook
# or if using VS Code, simply open the .ipynb files
```

Jupyter will list everything in the **samples** directory, and you can click to browse each section.

Before diving into the geoscience code samples, we recommend that you first test your Evo app to make sure your client credentials are set up correctly.

<img src="../docs/img/jupyter-start-here.png" alt="Jupyter start here" width="350" />

a. Click to open **auth-and-evo-discovery**.
b. Click to open **native-app-token.ipynb**.
c. Enter your **client ID** and **callback URL** from when you registered your Evo app.

<img src="../docs/img/notebook-auth-setup.png" alt="Auth setup" width="500" />

d. Run the first code cell by pressing Shift+Enter or by pressing the Play button in the toolbar.

e. Run the next code cell. You may see red warning text - this is normal.

f. If everything is set up correctly, your web browser should open a new tab and ask you to sign in with your Bentley ID. Once you have signed in and granted access to the app, return to the tab with Jupyter running.

g. Using the widget that appears under the code cell, select your Organisation, Hub and Workspace.

h. Run the next code cell. You should see a printout of your Evo hub URL, organisation ID and workspace ID.

The values printed in the last cell are required for almost all Evo API calls. This is because all Evo data is stored in a workspace that exists in your assigned Evo hub and organisation.

Now that you know how Evo auth works, explore the other Jupyter notebooks. They all require your client ID and callback URL, just like in this example.

**üìÅ [common-tasks](common-tasks/)**

This section includes tasks that are common across many of the Evo APIs.

Advanced file processing:
- Working with Parquet data files
- Data manipulation

## üîß Running a sample

1. **Open the notebook** in your preferred editor
1. **Update the first cell** with your client ID (and redirect URL if needed)
1. **Run the authentication cell** - this will open your browser for Bentley ID sign-in
1. **Select your workspace** using the provided widget
1. **Continue with the remaining cells** in order

## üí° Tips for success

- **Always start with authentication**: The auth-and-evo-discovery samples are prerequisite for all others
- **Check platform requirements**: Some geoscience-objects samples are Windows-specific
- **Use virtual environments**: Keep dependencies isolated for each project
- **Follow notebook order**: Run cells sequentially for best results
- **Keep credentials secure**: Never commit tokens or credentials to version control
